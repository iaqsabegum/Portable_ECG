# Portable ECG :
## Overview
The Portable ECG (Electrocardiogram) is a compact, user-friendly device designed to monitor heart activity on-the-go. This repository contains the design files for creating a portable ECG device, including the main schematic and mechanical design in the .f3d (Fusion 360) format. These files can be used to manufacture the device or as a reference for further development in building an efficient and wearable ECG system.

The goal of this project is to provide an open-source design for a portable ECG device that can be used for health monitoring, early detection of cardiac irregularities, or as a part of a larger medical diagnostics system.

## Key Features
<li>Portable Design: Compact and lightweight, making it ideal for continuous ECG monitoring while traveling or in various environments.
<li>User-Friendly Interface: Simple controls and interface for ease of use by individuals or healthcare providers.
<li>High-Quality ECG Readings: Provides accurate ECG readings to detect irregularities in heart activity.
<li>Wireless Connectivity (Optional): Some configurations may include options for Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity to sync ECG data with mobile apps or cloud platforms.
<li>Battery-Powered: Ensures portability without the need for constant charging or reliance on external power sources.

## Files Included
<li>ECG_Design.f3d – Main Fusion 360 design file for the mechanical housing of the ECG device.
<li>ECG_Circuit_Schematic.pdf – Basic schematic of the ECG circuit for interfacing electrodes and amplifiers.
<li>Assembly_Instructions.pdf – Guide for assembling the mechanical parts of the ECG device.
<li>Component_List.txt – List of key components required for the ECG device build (e.g., sensors, microcontrollers, etc.).

## How to Use
<li>Download the Files: Clone or download the repository to access the .f3d design files and accompanying documents.
<li>Open the .f3d File: Open the ECG_Design.f3d file using Autodesk Fusion 360. You can view, modify, or export the design as needed for 3D printing or manufacturing.
<li>Assemble the Device: Use the Assembly_Instructions.pdf for a step-by-step guide to assemble the components of the portable ECG device.
<li>Build the Circuit: Refer to the ECG_Circuit_Schematic.pdf for wiring and connections of the ECG sensors, amplifiers, and microcontroller.
<li>Test and Use: Once assembled, test the ECG device for functionality and begin using it to monitor heart activity.

## Requirements
<li>Fusion 360: Autodesk Fusion 360 or a compatible 3D modeling software to open and modify the .f3d design files.
<li>Electrodes
<li>Operational amplifiers
<li>Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)
<li>Battery
<li>Bluetooth/Wi-Fi module (optional)
<li>Additional Tools: 3D printer or CNC machine for manufacturing the casing, soldering iron for circuit assembly.
